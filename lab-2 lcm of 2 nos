# LCM of two numbers

x= float (input ("Enter first number: "))

y = float (input ("Enter second number: "))

f (x > y) :

greater = x

else:

greater = y

while (True):

if (greater x == 0) and (greater y == 0)) :

lcm = greater

break

greater += 1

print ("The L.C.M. is", lcm)


Output :
Enter first number:45
Enter second number:50
The L.C.M. is 450
